# TestRepo2 - Refactoring exercise. 

## Background
Imagine this is API for a user mgmt system where you want to connect 2 users together (e.g. like LinkedIn) 

## What you can expect?
* The project should build successfully with VS2019 
* And the unit tests ConnectionsControllerTests should run and all passed. (need Resharper UnitTest runner)

## Tasks
- Read the Post method in ConnectionsController
- How would you go about refactor it? A normal code refactor not about adding Services, or MediatR layer that kind of refactor.

## Unit Tests
- You can use it to test your refactoring.
